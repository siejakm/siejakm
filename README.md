Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here is my portfolio. Some of pages which i`ve done in my 2.5 years long career as a frontend/webdeveloper.

the websites listed below were written using technologies such as - HTML (I use Twig templates to write HTML to minimize the risk of mistakes, ensure order and a minimum amount of code, facilitate the work of backend developers), jQuery, javascript, scss, tailwind, css :

Wordpress -

<br>
I also built stores on Prestashop and WordPress, but the client for whom I built these websites had some problems, which is why the websites were not made public. Therefore, I cannot link them here, but if necessary, I can present them during the meeting :)
